# Contributing to Easily (JobPortal)

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is a learning/demo application, and contributions are welcome.

Guidelines

- Keep secrets out of commits. Use `.env` for credentials and never commit real passwords or tokens.
- If you add features, include brief tests or manual verification steps in a PR description.
- Keep changes small and focused. One feature or bugfix per PR is ideal.
- Run the app locally and verify flows (register, post job, apply, view applicants, download resume).

How to open a PR

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Make changes and commit with clear messages.
4. Push and open a PR describing what you changed and how to test it.

Style

- Follow existing code style and patterns (EJS views, ES modules, in-memory models).
- Add small comments for non-obvious logic.
